                            <h3><a href="#featurestory" class="external-link"></a>Bridging the gap: How Kate Stanko found her place in technical writing</a></h3>
                            
                            <p>
                              
        <br>
        
        Discover how Kate Stanko, a senior at Virginia Tech, found her calling in technical writing through her internship with Virginia Tech‚Äôs Division of Information Technology, where she bridges the gap between complex technology and everyday users. <br><br>
        <img src="./subpages/assets/2024_10_21 HokieBirdandKate-3 3.jpg" class="margins"><br><br>
        Stepping into the world of technology can be daunting, especially for a liberal arts student at a school known for its engineering prowess. For Kate Stanko, a senior at Virginia Tech double majoring in communications and professional and technical writing, an internship with Network Infrastructure and Services (NI&S) opened the door to a rewarding career path that balances her passion for technical writing with the challenge of making complex information accessible to a wider audience.  
        <br><br>
        ‚ÄúI love being the person who bridges the gap between technology and the general public,‚Äù Stanko said. For her, becoming intern with the Division of Information Technology at Virginia Tech was the perfect opportunity to establish connections in the technical world and contribute to something bigger. Her role, as she describes it, involves taking complex, technical material and transforming it into content that anyone can understand‚Äîa responsibility she embraces wholeheartedly.  
        <br><br>
        <strong>A day in the life of a technical writer  </strong>
        <br>
        On a typical day, Stanko navigates through articles, documentation, and style guides, ensuring that everything adheres to the unit‚Äôs standards. Her role is primarily remote, and her work remains seamless thanks to tools like Outlook, Slack, and Google Drive. With the flexibility of remote work, Kate can work on her projects from anywhere, even at the campus radio station where she holds the title of General Manager.  
        <br><br>
        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of coordination,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand I love that about this role. You have to balance detail orientation with broader communication goals.‚Äù  
        <br><br>
        One of her biggest tasks has been working on Virginia Tech‚Äôs migration to Zoom phones. As a technical writer, she was responsible for drafting the communications and user instructions for this shift, ensuring that all the information was clear, concise, and usable by both technical staff and end users.   
        <br><br>
        Her work on Zoom phone migration isn‚Äôt her only project. She has also helped develop instructions for VT OpenWiFi, collaborating closely with directors and other technical staff to make sure the final product met everyone‚Äôs needs.  
        
         ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of back and forth, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs rewarding to know I‚Äôve made something that‚Äôs going to help so many people,‚Äù she said.  
         <br><br>
        <strong>Collaborating with the experts </strong>
        <br>
        When she collaborates with the technical staff, Kate shares how invaluable their input has been in her writing.   
        <br><br>
        ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be an expert in IT to communicate the issues clearly,‚Äù she said. She believes her lack of technical experience actually empowers her to simplify complex ideas, making them more accessible to users who may be unfamiliar with the technology.  
        <br><br>
        ‚ÄúThe most challenging part of the job is standardizing content,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúThere are so many departments within IT, and they each have their own way of doing things. Everyone has different expectations, so it‚Äôs about finding that balance and creating a uniform approach.‚Äù This was particularly evident when she worked on documentation for the OpenWiFi project, where maintaining consistency across different departments was crucial.  
        <br><br>
        <strong>Skills and takeaways from the internship  </strong>
        <br>
        Stanko‚Äôs time with the unit has not only broadened her understanding of information technology but also sharpened her technical writing skills.   
        <br><br>
        ‚ÄúExperiential Learning opportunities, such as those with the Bridge Program, show students the connection between classroom knowledge and workplace skills. Hands-on learning experiences like her internship allow students to not only meet graduation requirements but also gain experience in their chosen fields,‚Äù said Dawn Knight, Advisor in the Department of English.  
        ‚ÄúFollowing a style guide is so important,‚Äù Kate said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about learning it but also reinforcing it with others. I‚Äôve definitely improved my attention to detail.‚Äù  
        <br><br>
        An essential part of her role has been tracking changes across a large body of work‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs updating old documentation or making sure that new instructions are consistent with past material.   
        <br><br>
        ‚ÄúI might be handed a big spreadsheet, and I have to track every mention of a particular tool or term to ensure it‚Äôs all aligned,‚Äù she said.  
        <br><br>
        <strong>Advice for future interns  </strong>
        <br><br>
        For students thinking about applying to an internship in her unit, her advice is simple: don‚Äôt be afraid.   
        
        ‚ÄúIt can be intimidating, especially as a liberal arts student going into a technical field,‚Äù she said ‚Äúbut there‚Äôs so much value in that unique perspective.‚Äù   
        <br><br>
        She said how rewarding it is to feel valued in a traditionally tech-heavy environment like Virginia Tech.   
        
        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs empowering,‚Äù Stanko said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned so much, and it‚Äôs great knowing I‚Äôve contributed to making things easier for others.‚Äù
